# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION WITH REGRESSION

This project is focused on predicting house prices using regression techniques. The dataset contains features related to house characteristics, and the goal is to predict the house prices based on these features using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

In this project, a dataset with various house features, such as size, location, number of rooms, etc., is used to train a regression model that can predict the price of a house. The project employs machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and build predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, relationships, and distributions within the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Implement and evaluate various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
